            If you're sending messages using the chatter, then, you probably want to know who are the users that
            have already read them.
            </p>
            <p/>
            <p>
            Every time a user accesses a record, the messages are marked as read and you'll see the names of the users as well
            as the date/time when the messages were presented to them.
